17 April 2024
Following feedback from GB
We wanted to separate the course management from the organisation.

-   Super User(Teacher) would be able to create and manage courses
-   Admins(Organisation) would be able to pick from the courses available and enroll Students(Members of Org / Employees) into those courses.
-   Students can only take a course that they have been enrolled in.

Due to this we decided to split the app into two account types

-   Teacher
-   Org (default).

As at 17 April 2024, we decided that the teacher would be GB. So all other accounts would be billable except his.

Organisations are further split into two

-   Admins (Managers of the org)
-   Students
